# GradeCalculator

PROJECT HISTORY:

v1: A set of sliders and slots for 1 HW that were connected together and allowed update. 

v2: Cutting and pasting for more HWs. Very clumsy

v3: used the way Kelly showed us in section to do an array of HWs.  

v4: Then it was easy to add 1 midterm an a final 

v5: Finally figured out how to connect to a function to compute grades.  Did grades incorrectly Pushed to repository

v6: Added a second midterm but had a bad bug that kept crashing on first click
        bad bug that kept crashing the system.  
        
v7: Next, broke up the grading part in another file grader.cpp and added the other courses.  

NOTES:

Uses a vertical format not a 2 column format as in the problem set example..  Looked fine to me

TEST CASES:

1.  Only 7 HWs all full, 8th zero
2.  Only 1 Final
3. Only 1 Midterm, rest zero
4. Same for second midterm
5. Various random combinations
