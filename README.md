# GradeCalculator
Grade calculator program.  I first started by doing a set of sliders and slots for 1 HW. Then I was manually cutting and pasting till 
Kelly showed us in section how to do an array of HWs.  Then it was easy to add the two midterms and in a next version the Final.  Had a 
bad bug that kept crashing the system.  Next, broke up the grading part in another file grader.cpp and added the course.
